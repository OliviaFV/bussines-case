This Bussines case is a first approach to an E-commerce page. :computer:
The project was done using Ruby on Rails, it is an example of a basic catalogue that you can add itmes to a shopping cart and remove them.
It is still a work in progress so all the front end is missing, but I'll get to it soon enough!
This is my first trial at taking a shot at an exercise
