This Bussines case is a first approach to an E-commerce page. :computer:
The project was done using Ruby on Rails, it is an example of a basic catalogue and you can add items to a shopping cart and remove them.
It is still a work in progress so all the front end is missing, but I'll get to it soon enough! :octocat:
This is my first time at taking a shot at an exercise provided by an employer so I am still very rough around the edges.

### Give it a try!  :dizzy:
To run locally, clone the repository (SSH) to you computer and run the server. Open you local host and and check it out.
